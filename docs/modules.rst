`ptwt` module list
================================

The Toolbox provides padded fast wavelet transforms
in the `conv_transform` modules. The `matmul_transform` modules support boundary wavelets. 
The `packet` module supports wavelet-packet transforms.
The continuous transform is implemented in the `continuous_transform` module.
The `sparse_math` module provides utility functions for the boundary
wavelet transforms. Finally, the experimental `learnable_wavelets`
module supports gradient descent optimization of wavelet filters
with soft constraints.
